# Model Selector Grouping Feature Changelog

## Overview
This update implements a grouped and collapsible model selector feature that organizes AI models by their prefixes (e.g., gpt-, claude-, gemini-) to improve user experience when dealing with long model lists.

## Feature Description
The Model Selector Grouping feature enables users to:
- View models organized by prefix groups (GPT Models, Claude Models, Gemini Models, etc.)
- Collapse/expand model groups to reduce visual clutter
- Maintain the same selection functionality with improved organization
- See model counts for each group
- Navigate between groups with smooth animations

## Changes Made

### 1. New Model Grouping Utility (`app/utils/model-grouping.ts`) [NEW FILE]
- Created `GroupedItems<T>` interface for grouped item structure
- Added `ModelGroup` interface defining group configurations
- Implemented `MODEL_GROUPS` array with predefined model prefixes:
  - `gpt-` → "GPT Models"
  - `claude-` → "Claude Models" 
  - `gemini-` → "Gemini Models"
  - `deepseek-` → "DeepSeek Models"
  - `llama-` → "Llama Models"
  - `qwen-` → "Qwen Models"
  - `yi-` → "Yi Models"
- Added `groupItemsByModelPrefix()` function to automatically categorize models
- Added `getGroupDisplayOrder()` function for consistent group ordering
- Models without matching prefixes are grouped under "Other Models"

### 2. Enhanced Selector Component (`app/components/ui-lib.tsx`)
- Added import for model grouping utilities
- Created new `GroupedSelector<T>` component with:
  - `grouped?: boolean` property to enable/disable grouping
  - `defaultExpandedGroups?: string[]` to specify initially expanded groups
  - Expand/collapse state management using React hooks
  - Fallback to original `Selector` when `grouped=false`
  - Group header with click-to-toggle functionality
  - Group content with conditional rendering based on expanded state
  - Maintained all original selector features (selection, multiple selection, etc.)

### 3. Styling and Animations (`app/components/ui-lib.module.scss`)
- Added `.selector-group-header` styles:
  - Flex layout with space-between alignment
  - Distinct background color and hover effects
  - Clickable cursor and user-select prevention
  - Smooth transitions for interactive states
- Added `.selector-group-title` for group name display with icon
- Added `.selector-group-icon` with rotation animation:
  - 180-degree rotation when expanded
  - Smooth 0.2s transition timing
- Added `.selector-group-count` for model count badges:
  - Rounded badge styling with primary color
  - Centered text alignment
- Added `.selector-group-content` for grouped items:
  - Increased left padding for visual hierarchy
  - Left border animation on hover
  - Improved hover states with color transitions

### 4. Chat Interface Integration (`app/components/chat.tsx`)
- Added `GroupedSelector` import to existing ui-lib imports
- Replaced `Selector` with `GroupedSelector` in model selection popup
- Added `grouped={true}` property to enable grouping feature
- Added `defaultExpandedGroups={["GPT Models", "Claude Models"]}` for better UX
- Maintained all existing selection logic and callbacks
- Preserved model display formatting and provider information

## Usage Instructions

1. Open any chat conversation
2. Click on the model selector button (robot icon) in the chat toolbar
3. The model selector will now display models organized by groups
4. Click on group headers to expand/collapse different model categories
5. Select any model from any group - selection works the same as before
6. Groups show model counts and remember their expanded/collapsed state during the session

## Technical Implementation Details

### Grouping Logic
- Models are automatically categorized by their name prefix
- Case-insensitive matching for broader compatibility
- Fallback to "Other Models" group for unmatched models
- Consistent ordering based on predefined group priority

### Component Architecture
- `GroupedSelector` extends the original `Selector` functionality
- Backward compatibility maintained through `grouped` prop
- State management using React hooks for expand/collapse
- Event propagation properly handled to prevent conflicts

### Performance Considerations
- Grouping is performed on-demand when selector opens
- Minimal re-renders through proper state management
- Smooth animations without affecting selection performance
- Memory efficient group state tracking

## UI/UX Improvements

### Visual Enhancements
- Clear visual hierarchy with group headers
- Smooth expand/collapse animations
- Consistent spacing and typography
- Hover effects for better interactivity
- Model count badges for quick reference

### Accessibility
- Proper click targets for group headers
- Visual feedback for interactive elements
- Maintained keyboard navigation support
- Consistent with existing design system

## Known Limitations
- Group definitions are currently hardcoded (easily extensible)
- No support for custom grouping rules per user
- Groups are not persisted between sessions
- Limited to prefix-based grouping only

## Future Enhancements
- User-customizable group definitions
- Persistent group expand/collapse states
- Search functionality within groups
- Alphabetical sorting within groups
- Support for custom grouping strategies
